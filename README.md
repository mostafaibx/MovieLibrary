# Movie Library Web App

This project is a single-page web application that demonstrates the use of Redux in a React application, along with Firebase for authentication and database management. It also utilizes the TMDB API to fetch movie data and Axios for making API requests.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to create a web application that interacts with APIs to both retrieve and post data. Specifically, it focuses on the following key aspects:

1. **Redux in React**: This project showcases how Redux, a state management library, can be integrated into a React application. Redux helps manage the application's state, making it easier to handle complex data interactions along with action creator to manage thunks.

2. **API Integration**: The application integrates with two APIs:
   - **TMDB API**: This API is used to obtain a dataset of movies. It demonstrates how to fetch data from an external source and display it in the application.
   - **Firebase**: Firebase is used for both authentication and as a database. It showcases user authentication using email and password, and also highlights the ability to store and retrieve data in real-time.
    
3. **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to external APIs.

## Features
